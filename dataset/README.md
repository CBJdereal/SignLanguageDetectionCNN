- **Project Overview**: This repository contains the development of a real-time sign language detector using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- **Dataset Source**: The dataset used in this project can be found at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/CBJdereal/Asl_data_set.git).
- **Dataset Composition**: The dataset includes six classes:
  - `A`
  - `M`
  - `N`
  - `S`
  - `T`
  - `Blank`
- **Selection Rationale**: The choice of these specific letters is strategic, focusing on enhancing the training rigor of the model. 
  - The letters A, M, N, S, and T have similar configurations, posing a significant challenge in differentiation.
- **Training Objective**: By successfully training the CNN to distinguish between these similar signs, the model is expected to generalize better and perform accurately with other, more distinct letters.
- **Expected Outcome**: This approach ensures robust and accurate recognition capabilities across the sign language spectrum.
- **Visual Aid**: Below is a depiction of the hand signs for A, M, N, S, T to illustrate their similarities and the challenges they present in recognition.
